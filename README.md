# The Operations Game

## Application
The application will make arbitrary, random bubbles of numbers depending on
the difficulty the user chooses. The user chooses arbitrary amount of numbers 
and does addition/multiplication which they choose at the start. The goal
is to get rid of all the numbers on the screen as fast as possible. It will
be timed.

Mainly for children learning addition and/or multiplication. I am
doing this project because as a child, I remember struggling
with multiplication. This game can help build foundation with the basic operations
in mathematics.
