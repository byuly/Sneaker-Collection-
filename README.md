# The Operations Game

## Application
The application will make arbitrary, random bubbles of numbers. The user 
chooses two numbers and does the operand that they choose at the start
with those two numbers. Each bubble will grow until it **POPS**, which is 
game over. Each operation that user does will give a point.

Mainly for children learning addition, subtraction, and multiplication. I am
doing this project because as a child, I remember struggling
with multiplication. This game can help build foundation with the basics
of mathematics. 

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to choose an operand (addition, subtraction, multiplication) for the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the range of numbers that will appear.
- As a user, I want to be able to click two bubbles, and be prompted to type the answer.
- As a user, I want to be able to get a point after each successful answer.
- As a user, I want to be able to pause game, quit game, but resume if it is not game over.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose difficulty (speed of the bubbles popping).
- As a user, I want to be able to track high score, and be able to reset it.
